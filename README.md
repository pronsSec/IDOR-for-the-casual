# IDOR-for-the-casual

**Do you like to IDOR? Are you a Windows hax0r?**

Well have I got a tool for you...

**A casual IDOR exploiter that provides .csv files of url and status code.** 

You also get a sick visualization by status code which you can save for your report ... or just use to look at how many of each ya got. 

This is meant to be run in Google Colaboratory, but can be run in Jupyter notebooks as well with some work. 
There is a "View In Colab" above the picture in idor_dashboard. Click this and a Colaboratory notebook will open automatically with a functioning GUI. 

**No need to bother with the command line, and no use of your personal RAM when fuzzing. Also the .csv files can be sorted by response code in ...**drumroll**... Microsoft Excel. **Because you are a Windows hax0r like myself.** 

Bye

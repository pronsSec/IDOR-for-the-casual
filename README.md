# IDOR-for-the-casual
A casual IDOR exploiter that provides .csv files of url and status code. 

This is meant to be run in Google Colaboratory, but can be run in Jupyter notebooks as well with some work. 
There is a "View In Colab" above the picture in idor_dashboard. Click this and a Colaboratory notebook will open automatically with a functioning GUI. 

No need to bother with the command line, and no use of your personal RAM when fuzzing.
